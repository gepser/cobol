# COBOL Learning  

Here I will put my `COBOL` stuff while learning. Yes, you read it right, I said `COBOL`.

You say why and I say why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

Sometimes I like to code/learn/do weird stuff.

I have done a little bit of `COBOL` in the past but I remember almost nothing, so here I am remembering it just for fun.

## My Setup

I am working on OSX Sierra and I installed cobol with `brew`:

    brew install gnu-cobol

## Compile

For compiling this examples you can use:

    cobc -x -free hello.cob

## Running it

    ./hello

The output should be:

    Hello World!

## Some help

I am reading this [GNU COBOL 2.0 Programmers Guide](https://open-cobol.sourceforge.io/guides/GNU%20COBOL%202.0%20Programmers%20Guide.pdf) and of course, using Google too.
